# circloo-savedata-modifier
Programs that can change level editor data in circloO. Only text converter and pixel placer are useful.

Obtain level save data by copying to clipboard in the level editor, then paste in a text file.

Alternatively, to find level save data, go to 'C:\Users\\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\circloO2'.

'Start number:' is the number where you want to insert new data into (uses '<'). It refers to the index the coords will be printed as, and it should be ONE MORE than the end index in the file, or the number you want to replace.

'Enter coords:' requires you to paste the data that will be used/changed.

Results of these programs are printed afterwards and must be copy-pasted into the level save file (without overlapping indexes).

Purposes of these programs should be used recreationally only, and only for circloO. Ask permission for anything else.

I am not responsible for loss, hinderance, or modification of any data, levels, or houseplants.
