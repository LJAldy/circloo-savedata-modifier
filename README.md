# circloo-savedata-modifier
Programs that can change level editor data in circloO. Only useful for the steam version. 

To find level save data, go to 'C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\circloO2'.

Each level save in the level editor is in there as 'le_level_1.sav' (replace 1 with any number).

Level names for each are in 'le_SaveNames'.

Copy-paste into 'circlooshapetranslate' using the SHAPE COORDS first THEN the index number (using '<').

Results of both programs are printed afterwards and must be copy-pasted into the level save file (without overlapping indexes).

Start number refers to the index the coords will be printed as, and it should be ONE MORE than the end index in the file.

Purposes of both programs should be used recreationally only, and only for circloO. Ask permission for anything else.

I am not responsible for loss, hinderance, or modification of any data, levels, or houseplants.
